Hi Evacuees in Calgary.

My boyfriend (Wain Dempsey) and I are trying to find out where in Calgary his dad was sent. His dad’s name is Brian Dempsey. 

Brian is in his mid 70’s approximately 6 feet tall and around 150 to 165 pounds. He has a mostly white beard, and is bald. Normally wears a ball cap and glasses. 

He doesn’t have a cell phone and we are very worried about him. 

Wain has tried contacting the Red Cross and the Calgary evacuation number and has not heard back from either. 

If anyone has seen Brian please contact myself or Wain by commenting below or by pm. 

Thank you.

Brian is on the right. He’s a little thinner in the face and his beard is a little longer.",,2023-08-27T16:22:49.000Z,1.0,Chelsea Simister,"Hey there just saw this!

The KFN leadership made arrangements for most members to stay in one hotel. It is good to be together as a community. People are visiting in various places around the hotel with children playing behind the hotel on a hill. The crisis seems to be bringing our Dene traditional values of socializing back to life. 

All the challenges we face in our community is still evident. But living together in such close proximities seems to be having a positive impact.  We are responding with love, kindness, respect and care. 

When you pray you humble yourself before God. This humility will come alive when interacting in your community. You will make a difference, so keep praying.",1.0,2023-08-18T13:54:08.000Z,0.0,Mavis Marie Jumbo,🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️,,2023-08-18T15:48:18.000Z,0.0,Jerome Constant,🌧️🌦️☔️💧🙏👏

I am located SW in Orchards - 15 minutes away from the Edmonton Airport. I unfortunately can’t drive as I am disabled but all donations are at my house waiting for people to take what they need.

Question: I arrived in Edmonton late on Tuesday night with my family and made arrangements for a hotel. I missed the St. Albert registration so I went to Leduc the following day. I didn’t receive a wrist band. When speaking with the hotel about a possible extension they asked for my registration number or my wrist band… both of which I didn’t get. I called every registeration centre, spoke to multiple people and no one seems to have access to what I would assume is a database?

I'm wondering if anyone would be interested in sharing their story about how they got out of the NWT, what challenges you faced along the way and any advice you may have for people starting the trip today or tomorrow.

Below is my post from our 2nd day of evacuation in High Level. Just thought I would share as it seems what you post on Facebook does not always get seen. 

I’m not a person to normally rant on this platform but after being evacuated for the 3rd time in 2 years I just cannot help but speak out. 

This EIDS relief payment is not a fair payment relief for those of us that work hard for our money and have awesome companies that keep us employed and paid during an evacuation (then again I may not be getting paid who knows till you get back to work ). But if I was not evacuated I would have my money in my bank account not using it for hotel bills beyond my control due to evacuation. Everyone should be treated with the same assistance. There are people getting a week of free hotel bills plus meals and then can claim $750 from the GNWT on this site. While I see seniors (and not just seniors) here in high level paying out of pocket  because they cannot physically make the long drives, or sleeping on cots in an arena
This only teaches us to stay in a dangerous situation and wait to be rescued to get fair treatment.

Before I end my rant. May I just send out a big thank you to every person in the registration centre here in High Level for the respect and comfort shown even when they were not instructed to do so. And all the High level people who have welcomed us into their community. 

Thank you all for taking the time to read my post hopefully the GNWT politicians will take a moment and read it as well.",,,,,

Just wanting to share our experience arriving in Calgary. We were lucky enough that we got directions and help by one of our retired Jazz FA. Upon arriving in Calgary, register at Westin Hotel near the airport. They are on the second floor. You will need ID and list of your family members with you. They will then assign you hotel and how many rooms needed. Some are at Hotel Clique and some at the Westin. They booked us a 7 day stay and as per the hotel agent, the coordinators will let them know if they need to extend. We were also provided some meal vouchers. $50/day per person. There are great information they can provide too. Emergency contacts for medication refills for example or if you need any medical needs. As told by the Alberta representative, the airport process will be the same when flying in and there are Alberta Representative desk set up upon arrival. They are open 8am to midnight.

She is not in great health. I don’t know if she is able to get to the airport either. I’m in in the states (PA) and have not heard from her since Sunday evening. I am worried sick and am just looking for suggestions on how I can maybe get more information/have someone check if she is still in her house. She is not in town, she is on Back Road.  I am guessing all emergency personnel evacuated! I have no idea where to turn. PLEASE let me know if you can help.  ***The Address is 47131 Back Road.  It is the log house.",1.0,2023-08-16T22:35:37.000Z,1.0,Karla Peterson,Gene Hachey could you check on this lady?,11.0,2023-08-16T22:57:08.000Z,3.0,Carole Carnell,What is her name in case any of us has seen her?

This hotel is the one that is giving the meals in GP so very handy. Just a thought.  Things are changing minute by minute so hopefully this isn’t out of date info.

Camping spots/ 2 bunk trailers available north of Valleyview with showers got food, full kitchen available.  Free.  Pm Garth Carman or Linda Carman for direction.

If you have gas for lawnmowers in jerry cans, use it to avoid waiting in line.  You cannot carry it with you in a fire zone.  Put it in yours or someone else’s vehicle.  Siphon out of those quads you leave behind, etc.

Bring cash for the road.

Please do not drive recklessly or with excessive speed, everyone needs to get out alive.

Have one set of clothes for each family member in different suitcases if in different vehicles in case you are separated.  

Have one southern family member become your central checking point no matter where you are and DO check in.

Please take your pet with you or provide your address, phone number, your southern contact name/number and the name number of who is watching your pet to a locator team like “vets without borders”.

Terry Dean Shott,0,2,2023-08-18T00:47:05.000Z,0,"⚠️ Fire Information Update – Aug 17, 2023 @ 1 p.m.

⚠️ Wood Buffalo Complex (previously Parks Canada Fire 7, Alberta Wildfire MNZ003, and NWT SS069)

As of yesterday evening, the Government of Northwest Territories, Parks Canada, and Alberta Wildfire have made the decision to enter Unified Command. Unified Command means that there is shared responsibility of command among all agency Incident Commanders. 

This decision was made because there was originally a wildfire in Wood Buffalo National Park that has now breached the Northwest Territories and Alberta borders. Once a wildfire crosses jurisdictional boundaries, multiple agencies may start working in close quarters and establishing Unified Command will help keep objectives and communications clear. 

This creates a safer environment to work on the wildfire as all agencies know where all resources are working. This also allows for better utilization of resources so that operations can work in tandem, rather than working around each other.

➡️Wood Buffalo Complex is currently 431,198 hectares in size. It is located approximately 4km south of Fort Smith, NWT and 6km south of Fort Fitzgerald, AB.

➡️Collectively, there are 163 personnel, 21 helicopters and 29 pieces of heavy equipment responding to the Wood Buffalo Complex today. 

Thanks to the increased humidity and light winds the Wood Buffalo Complex wildfire in Wood Buffalo National Park has had little growth over the past two days. Last night, we received 1mm of precipitation in Fort Smith. 

Today’s priority continues to be placed on efforts to prevent the fire from impacting Fort Smith, the Fort Smith airport, Fort Fitzgerald, Smith’s Landing First Nation, Thebacha, Bordertown, Halfway and Bell Rock.

A fire guard was established around part of the fire on the east side of Highway 5 near where the Salt River runs under the road. Today, crews are finishing work along the guard to extinguish hot spots, with the help of helicopter bucketing. An old fire guard has been re-established running from west 40 at Highway 5 west of Fort Smith and has now been connected to the airport to aid in community protection. We are also creating a fire guard around Fort Fitzgerald and Smith’s Landing First Nation.

Crews continue to examine opportunities to conduct strategic micro-ignition efforts near Highway 5 to gently bring the fire to the pavement. Removing fuel prior to an approaching fire can slow down the spread of fire once it joins up with the burned area.

⚠️It remains unsafe for residents to return to Fort Smith and Fort Fitzgerald. The Town of Fort Smith and Fort Fitzgerald have declared a STATE OF LOCAL EMERGENCY and it remains under an EVACUATION ORDER. The ORDER has been issued for public safety. Highway 5 is currently closed from Hay River to Fort Smith due to safety concerns from fire activity and limited visibility.

Please visit the Smith’s Landing First Nation’s Facebook for EVACUATION information Smith's Landing First Nation

Please visit the Fort Smith website for up-to-date emergency planning information: Town of Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, Canada

In order to reduce unnecessary stress on limited critical resources in the community of Fort Smith such as potable water, communication lines, health care services and the local power supply, non-essential first responders were relocated to nearby locations earlier this week. Essential first responders continue to remain in place.

🔥 Fire 18 and Fire 23
Parks Canada will continue to actively monitor these fires as they have the potential to impact efforts to address Fire 7.

🔥 Other fires in Wood Buffalo National Park
Other fires in the park currently do not pose a risk to public safety at this time. We will continue to monitor as required.

⚠️Due to ongoing fire behaviour and fire operations in the area, the Pine Lake Road and Recreation Area remain closed. It is unsafe to be in this area at this time.

The Leduc Cinema is great with low prices 10$ per adult ticket and 7$ for children ￼for all movies! TMNT, Barbie, Meg2 and Oppenheimer are being played I believe. 

The Leduc Recreation Centre also has very affordable prices and good facilities swimming, sports and all sorts! I’ll attach a photo with rates below.

For Immediate Release 

Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. Offers Assistance to Nunavut Inuit Affected by Evacuation Orders
(August 17, 2023, Iqaluit, Nunavut) As wildfires continue to threaten communities in the Northwest Territories (NWT) and displace families from their homes, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. (NTI) is taking measures to extend support to affected Nunavut Inuit households. This vital initiative aims to provide immediate relief to eligible households impacted by evacuation orders, including those in Yellowknife, Ndilo, Dettah, Enterprise, Fort Smith, Hay River, Jean Marie River, and Behchoko.

In response to the urgent need, NTI is introducing relief in the form of a one-time payment of $1,000 per household. This assistance is intended to alleviate the immediate challenges faced by Nunavut Inuit households directly affected by the evacuation orders.

Nunavut Inuit households with established addresses within the impacted communities are automatically approved and should contact NTI to provide direct deposit information. 

In cases where the enrolled address does not match evacuation orders, but the individual resides therein, proof of residency along with direct deposit information should be provided to NTI. Examples of proof of residency include a driver’s licence, utility bill or a lease.

Additionally, NTI recognizes the challenges faced by Inuit communities beyond the Northwest Territories and acknowledges that evacuation orders may have impacted individuals in other parts of Canada. To this end, NTI extends support to any Nunavut Inuit households that have been evacuated due to natural disasters such as wildfires, flooding, and others, regardless of their location in 2023. Nunavut Inuit should submit a copy of the evacuation order, alongside proof of residency and direct deposit information.

Contact NTI by email to relief@tunngavik.com or toll-free phone to 1-888-236-5400. The direct deposit form is available for download on NTI’s website at www.tunngavik.com. Be advised that payments may take 1 to 2 weeks to process.

Is there any available kennels for a large crybaby dog? He hasn't been on his own before so he'll cry but if he's loved on I think he'll be okay. He's shy around new people, but he'll warm up I think.

We'll be in High Level in an hour or two but couldn't get stable internet service to right this sooner 😔

I am in High Level since Sunday night. 
I know there may be  some Hay River friends sleeping in their cars here in high Level. 

We have several friends staying at our property just north of town 
Some are in holiday trailers
Some are in tents 
There’s a house there for showers and washrooms
And there’s wifi

I hadn’t heard from Jeff because wifi has been out in Hay River since Sunday evening. A few star link stations. Out of the blue I get a text from Jeff “hey Mom, I guess you finally have the commune you always wanted”. Very funny. But thanks to one lovely guest that mowed all the grass yesterday. Another who was pruning all the lilac trees. Another amazing cook who is offering some pretty spectacular home cooked meals. So I guess it is like a little evacuation commune. 🙂

Please pm me if we can do anything to help any of our friends here.
